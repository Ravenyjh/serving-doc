The 0G Compute Network is designed to seamlessly connect AI users and providers, making it easy for AI users to access a wide range of compute and model services. As part of this, the framework is built to provide trust and settlement between providers and users that do not know each other, as would be expected in the distributed AI economy.

We additionally integrate with many different sources of AI demand, enabling them to charge for their offerings while ensuring that the services delivered to users are verifiable.

## Components

**Contract:** This component determines the legitimacy of settlement proofs, manages accounts, and handles service information. To do this, it stores variables during the service process, including account information, service details (such as name and URL), and consensus logic.

**Provider:** These are the owners of models and hardware who offer their services to earn revenue.

**User:** Individuals or organizations who use the services listed by providers. It is possible to use AI services directly and build applications on top of our API.

## Process Overview

The 0G Compute Network implements the following workflow:

1. **Service Registration**
   - Providers register their services' types, URLs, and prices in the smart contract.
2. **User Stake**
   - Users deposit a certain amount into the smart contract for service fees. If the accumulated charges from user requests exceed their deposit, the provider will stop responding.
3. **Request Submission**
   - Users or developers send requests, along with metadata and signatures, to the service provider.
4. **Provider Response**
   - Providers respond based on the user's balance and the request's validity.
5. **Settlement and Verification**
   - Providers generate a [zero-knowledge proof (ZK-proof)](https://github.com/0glabs/0g-zk-settlement-server?tab=readme-ov-file) and submit it to the smart contract for verification and settlement.
6. **User Verification**
   - Users verify the provider's response and can stop requests if the verification fails.

This brief overview introduces the foundational workflow. For more detailed steps, please refer to the full documentation.

## Get Involved

If you're interested in becoming a **Provider**, please refer to [the Provider section](./provider.md) for detailed guidelines and requirements.

If you wish to leverage provider services to develop your own projects, relevant resources are available in [the Developer SDK section](./developer-sdk).

For those looking to directly access services from a **Provider**, more information can be found in [the Marketplace section](./marketplace.md).
